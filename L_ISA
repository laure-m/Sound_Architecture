L-ISA

1. Download and install L-ISA Controller and L-ISA Processor
	You must run both at the same time

2. In your DAW change the Audio Hardware / Routing so that the Device Input/Output is L-ISA Bridge

3. In the L-ISA Processor, in Audio Settings: 
	the input should be L-ISA Bridge
	the output should be your headphones

4. In the L-ISA Controller click on "Processors", drag your computer into the "Main" dropdown space and hit the "connect" button. This should draw a green arrow saying the controller is now connected to the computer. 

5. Back in your DAW, each track output should be made to be Mono > L-ISA Bridge Out #X, each track should be a diffferent Mono output

6. In L-ISA Controller we need to use the Binaural Template. Click on the top next to the L-ISA logo, select "New From Template" and then "12.0 L-Acoustics Binaural..."

7. Click on "Sources" then "Overview" and label and colorize each source to match your DAW Tracks

8. Click on the "Soundscape" tab, you can move each of the inputs around in space, distance, width, etc

9. Now to test it, when you play your DAW, open the Processor and you should see inputs lighting up as that track is played.
